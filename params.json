{"name":"Data Warehouse","body":"Data Warehouse\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThe NYU Libraries DataWarehouse is a utility library for retrieving data from a data warehouse.\r\nNYU connects to a variety of databases in the warehouse for Primo enrichment plugins,\r\nbut the library can be used for any processes requiring connection to RDBMS.\r\n\r\nThe NYU Libraries DataWarehouse expects a file specifying the connection information.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the [API documentation](http://nyulibraries.github.com/datawarehouse/apidocs)\r\n\r\nThe project leverages [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) for managing dependencies, building, packaging and generating Javadocs.\r\n\r\nTo install the package locally, run:\r\n\r\n    $ mvn install\r\n\r\nNYU uses SQL Server and therefore requires the SQL Server JDBC driver to \r\nconnect to our servers.  In our tests we use this driver.\r\n\r\nOnce you download the driver, you must it to your local maven repository.\r\n\r\n    $ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=sqljdbc4.jar \\ \r\n    -Dpackaging=jar -DgroupId=com.microsoft.sqlserver \\ \r\n    -DartifactId=sqljdbc4 -Dversion=4.0\r\n\r\nThe NYU Libraries uses [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano) as its deploy tool. \r\nThe deploy mechanism assumes [rvm](https://rvm.io/ \"Ruby Version Manager\") and \r\n[Ruby 1.9.3-p125](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2012/02/16/ruby-1-9-3-p125-is-released/) \r\non the local deploy host but they may not be necessary. \r\nIn order to deploy: \r\n\r\n    $ cap [-S branch=<branch-name>] [-S user=<user-name>] [staging|production] deploy:<task>\r\n\r\nSince the DataWarehouse library can be leveraged across systems, deploy tasks are created for specific deploys.\r\nCurrently the following deploy tasks are available\r\n\r\n  - enrichment\r\n","tagline":"Provides a connection to the NYU Libraries data warehouse","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
